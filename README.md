The code is designed for educational purposes and can serve as a foundation for understanding stack operations in Python.

# Features :
-> Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
-> Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
-> Remove: Remove a specific element from the stack.
-> Display: Show all elements currently in the stack.
-> Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for common issues such as popping from an empty stack or removing non-existent elements.
